## About the Project <a name="about-project"></a>

The **Tabula Muris** project is a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of *Mus musculus* (mouse), covering data from over 100,000 cells across 20 different organs. The primary goal is to offer a valuable resource for cell biology and provide insights into poorly characterized cell populations. Employing advanced techniques such as microfluidic droplet-based counting and full-length transcript analysis, the project goes beyond traditional cell characterization methods.

### Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Other dependencies (please refer to the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section for details)

#### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

- **Mouse Atlas Creation:** Comprehensive analysis of single-cell transcriptomic data from various organs.
- **Cell Type Characterization:** Definition of cell types using advanced methods, revealing insights into poorly characterized populations.
- **Methodological Comparison:** Comparison of two distinct single-cell RNA-sequencing methods (FACS and microfluidic-droplet) to understand technical biases and differences.
- **Global Clustering:** Exploration of relationships between cells from different organs to identify shared and distinct cell types.
