    "# Tabula Muris: A Comprehensive Mouse Atlas - Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scientific Context\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "The Tabula Muris project is a groundbreaking effort that presents a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the model organism Mus musculus (mouse). With data from over 100,000 cells across 20 different organs and tissues, the study aims to provide a valuable resource for cell biology. Advanced techniques such as microfluidic droplet-based counting and full-length transcript analysis were employed to move beyond traditional cell characterization by morphology. The primary objective is to offer a detailed molecular understanding of cell types, enabling comparisons across organs and shedding light on poorly characterized cell populations.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "This study revolves around single-cell transcriptomic data from Mus musculus, creating a Mouse Atlas known as Tabula Muris. By analyzing over 100,000 cells from 20 different mouse organs, the research explores the mysteries of the cell, moving beyond traditional classifications based on appearance and behavior. The focus is on understanding cell properties through precise examination of gene expression patterns.\n",

    "- Principal component analysis (PCA) and nearest-neighbor graph-based clustering for each organ independently.\n",
    "- Cluster-specific gene expression, known markers, and differentially expressed genes used for cell-type annotations.\n",
    "- Annotations followed a standardized vocabulary (cell ontology) for inter-experiment comparisons.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
